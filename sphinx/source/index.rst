gistools - various spatial analysis tools generally built upon geopandas
========================================================================

The gistools package is a bunch of misc convenience functions on top of geopandas, shapely, and rasterio for more complicated tasks.
Also included is a module that contains functions for catchment delineation of NIWA's REC network and associated functions.

The GitHub repository is found `here <https://github.com/mullenkamp/gistools>`_

A parameter estimation function hs also been added to the base class to convert most any variety of metereological parameter inputs to the necessary parameters needed to calculate ETo.
